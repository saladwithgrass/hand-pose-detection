address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {We address the problem of computing the 3-dimensional shape of an
            arbitrary scene from a set of images taken at known viewpoints.
            Multi-camera scene reconstruction is a natural generalization of
            the stereo matching problem. However, it is much more difficult
            than stereo, primarily due to the difficulty of reasoning about
            visibility. In this paper, we take an approach that has yielded
            excellent results for stereo, namely energy minimization via graph
            cuts. We first give an energy minimization formulation of the
            multi-camera scene reconstruction problem. The energy that we
            minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility
            properly, and imposes spatial smoothness while preserving
            discontinuities. As the energy function is NP-hard to minimize
            exactly, we give a graph cut algorithm that computes a local
            minimum in a strong sense. We handle all camera configurations
            where voxel coloring can be used, which is a large and natural
            class. Experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of our
            approach.},
